HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN EXAMPLE CASE.

1. Prepare the Makefile by copying Makefile.generic to Makefile (within src/).
You should set the following preprocessor options:
	AROPT = -Dget_areav  (optional)
	NCOPT = -Duse_netcdf
	CYCLIC = -Dcyclic_ocean
	HFLUX = -Dnb_hflux
You will also need to un-comment the Makefile variables relevant to your system. As a guide, you will need FC, FFLAGS, LAPACK, NCDIR, NCLIB, IDIR and NCLINK defined.

2. Either link or copy the relevant parameter.src file to the src directory. For example:
> ln -s ../examples/southern_ocean/parameter.src parameter.src

3. Make the code:
> make q-gcm

4. You will need to download the topography file soctopog.26deg.10km.nc and put it in this directory. This file is available on the Q-GCM downloads webpage on www.q-gcm.org.

5. This configuration struggles with the shock of sudden startup. The best way to get around this is to download a restart file from a spun up state (lastday.nc) from year 100 from the Q-GCM downloads webpage on www.q-gcm.org. Alternatively, if you want to start a southern ocean case from scratch, we recommend a gentle start for the first 30 or so years, using the reduced radiative forcing parameters given in the alternative parameters file, input.param.spinup.

6. Move to this directory and run the code. 
The included qgrun_pbs shell script show an example of how to do this, but you will need to configure this script for your system.
