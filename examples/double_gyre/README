HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE DOUBLE GYRE EXAMPLE CASE.

1. Prepare the Makefile by copying Makefile.generic to Makefile (within src/).
You should set the following preprocessor options:
	AROPT = -Dget_areav  (optional)
	NCOPT = -Duse_netcdf
	HFLUX = -Dsb_hflux
You will also need to un-comment the Makefile variables relevant to your 
system. As a guide, you will need FC, FFLAGS, LAPACK, NCDIR, NCLIB, IDIR, 
NCDINC and NCLINK defined.

2. Either link or copy the relevant parameter.src file to the src directory. 
For example:
> ln -s ../examples/double_gyre/parameter.src parameter.src

3. Make the code:
> make q-gcm

4. Move to this directory and run the code. 
You shouldn't need any specific input files.
The included qgrun and qgrun_pbs shell scripts show examples of how to run 
a sequence of end-to-end simulations.
