    "project_desc": "OpenQG is an intermediate complexity mid-latitude coupled climate model. The model uses quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics in both ocean and atmosphere so that the momentum equations can be solved quickly, while non-linear dynamics and high resolution in the ocean can be retained.",
