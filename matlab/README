MATLAB SCRIPTS FOR Q-GCM

These matlab scripts are designed to read and analyse Q-GCM output.
You will need SNCTools installed to run these scripts.
Note that most files are written as functions, called by qgrun.m - best to read that file to get an idea of how to run things.
We have assumed that your data is saved within folders called, for example yrs000-005. If you have separate spinup runs which you want excluded from averaging but would still like monitoring data, rename those cases to spinup_yrs000-005.
